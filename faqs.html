                    <summary>Why not just go to Bulgaria/Andorra/somewhere cheap?</summary>
                    <p>Fair question! Tim tried that once. The lifts broke down, the snow was slush, and the "luxury" chalet had a view of a car park. Now he's spent 20+ weeks in Courchevel and refuses to ski anywhere else. Yes, it's pricier, but you get: actual snow, lifts that work, and a hot tub that doesn't smell weird. Your call!</p>

                    <summary>I can't ski. Like, at all. Help?</summary>
                    <p>Perfect! Half the group usually can't ski either. Day 1: You'll fall over. A lot. Day 2: You'll fall over slightly less. Day 3: You'll make it down a green run and feel like a hero. By the end of the week, you'll be racing others to the bar. We book lessons with English-speaking instructors who are used to terrified beginners.</p>

                    <summary>Can't I just book this myself on Booking.com?</summary>
                    <p>Sure, if you enjoy: comparing 47 different transfer companies, working out which ski pass covers what, finding a chalet for exactly 12 people, discovering the "ski-in/out" chalet is actually a 20-minute bus ride away... Tim's already made all these mistakes so you don't have to. Plus he knows which day to ski where based on weather/crowds/hangovers.</p>

            <h2>The Practical Stuff</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's included in the accommodation?</summary>
                    <p>The chalet comes with all bedding, towels, bathrobes, mid-week cleaning, end-of-stay cleaning, WiFi, and full use of the hot tub and sauna. The kitchen is fully equipped for self-catering, though most evenings we eat out together.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I join for part of the week?</summary>
                    <p>Unfortunately not - the chalet is booked for the full week and costs are split equally among all participants. It also helps with group dynamics when everyone's there for the full experience.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does room allocation work?</summary>
                    <p>We have 6 bedrooms (2 doubles, 1 twin, 3 TBC). Couples get priority for doubles, then it's first-come-first-served. Everyone gets a proper bed - no sofa beds or floor mattresses.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What about dietary requirements?</summary>
                    <p>La Tania has good restaurants that cater to most dietary needs. When we book group meals, we always check requirements. The chalet has a full kitchen if you need to prepare specific meals.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does Tim actually know secret spots or is he making it up?</summary>
                    <p>20+ weeks = a lot of exploring. He knows: the tree run that ALWAYS has powder two days after a dump, the restaurant with the secret local menu (half price, twice as good), which lift to hit at 11:17am when everyone's at lunch, and that weird cut-through that saves 20 minutes getting back. He's basically a snow nerd at this point.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if I'm actually good at skiing?</summary>
                    <p>Brilliant! While the beginners are learning to pizza, you can explore: Saulire couloirs (proper steep stuff), Val Thorens glacier (highest skiing in Europe), epic off-piste through the trees, or just blast around showing off. Tim knows where the good stuff is, and there's always someone keen for "just one more run" at 4pm.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is the hot tub actually that good?</summary>
                    <p>Picture this: It's 5pm. Your legs are jelly. There's snow falling. You're in a hot tub with a beer, looking at mountains, planning tomorrow's routes, and someone's telling a story about their spectacular wipeout. Yes. It's that good. It's basically 40% of why we book this specific chalet.</p>
