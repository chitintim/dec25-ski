                    <summary>How do I book my spot?</summary>
                    <p>WhatsApp Tim to confirm your interest. The chalet is already booked so it's just a matter of confirming numbers. Once confirmed, you'll need to transfer your share of the accommodation cost. Book your own flights ASAP as prices increase closer to the date.</p>

                    <summary>What are the exact dates?</summary>
                    <p>Sunday 21st December - Sunday 28th December 2025. This is a full week booking. Check-in is from 3pm on the 21st, check-out by 10am on the 28th.</p>

                    <summary>Can I join for part of the week?</summary>
                    <p>You're welcome to stay fewer nights BUT you still need to pay for the full week accommodation. You'd also need to arrange your own transfers if not flying with the group. The chalet is booked for the full week and can't be split.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What's the total cost?</summary>
                    <p>Use our cost calculator for a personalised estimate. Roughly £1,200-1,700 per person including accommodation (£630-755), flights (£150-320), transfers (£80), ski pass (£280-350), equipment, food and insurance. Beginners typically spend less (Courchevel-only pass, cheaper equipment).</p>

                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>When do I need to pay?</summary>
                    <p>Accommodation payment ASAP to secure your spot. Book your own flights immediately - they get expensive. Other costs (ski pass, equipment) can be sorted closer to the date. Transfer cost will be confirmed once we know final numbers.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Are there any hidden costs?</summary>
                    <p>Main costs are transparent. Don't forget: drinks (€16 champagne at La Folie Douce!), lunch on the mountain (€15-25), groceries (£50-120), and any activities like spa visits (€35) or tobogganing (€15). Private chef is optional at £340-420pp for the week.</p>

                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Can I get a refund if I can't go?</summary>
                    <p>Unfortunately no - the chalet is paid for upfront and we can't get refunds. Consider winter sports insurance that covers cancellation. Your spot can be transferred to someone else if you find a replacement.</p>

                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Which flights should I book?</summary>
                    <p>EasyJet from Luton (13:45 out, 20:35 back) is cheapest at £243 with luggage or £150 without. BA from Gatwick includes free ski carriage at £280. We have a group transfer at 17:00 from Geneva on 21st, returning 14:00 on 28th. Book ASAP!</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What about transfers?</summary>
                    <p>Already booked! Private transfer for 8 people at €735 total (£80pp). If we get more people, the per-person cost reduces. Includes all luggage and ski equipment. Alternative: Ben's Bus at £30-81 if you're flying at different times.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Do I need a car in resort?</summary>
                    <p>No - La Tania is small and walkable. The chalet is near the slopes and village centre. Everything (ski hire, supermarket, restaurants) is within a 5-10 minute walk. The shuttle bus runs to Courchevel if needed.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What documents do I need?</summary>
                    <p>Valid passport (check expiry date!). No visa needed for EU. Comprehensive winter sports insurance is essential - check it covers off-piste if you plan to go off the marked runs. European Health Insurance Card (EHIC/GHIC) recommended.</p>

            <h2>For First-Time Skiers</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>I've never skied - will I hold everyone back?</summary>
                    <p>Not at all! We usually have several beginners and the group splits naturally by ability. Everyone meets for lunch and après-ski. By day 3, most beginners are happily cruising green runs. The social side is as important as the skiing!</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Should I book lessons?</summary>
                    <p>Highly recommended for beginners! Group lessons are £280 for 6 mornings. Even better: find 2 other beginners and share private lessons at £117pp for 2 sessions or £175pp for 3 sessions. Private instruction makes a huge difference to progress.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What equipment do I need?</summary>
                    <p>Rent skis, boots, poles and helmet locally (£90-170 for the week). You'll need to bring: ski jacket & trousers, thermal layers, ski socks, gloves, goggles, sun cream, and après-ski clothes. Don't buy equipment before trying - rent first!</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What if I hate it?</summary>
                    <p>There's loads to do besides skiing! Aquamotion spa (€35), tobogganing, snowshoeing, shopping in Courchevel, or just enjoying the mountain restaurants and hot tub. Several non-skiers have joined previous trips and loved it.</p>

            <h2>The Chalet & Resort</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What's the chalet like?</summary>
                    <p>Chalet La Koala: 6 bedrooms (sleeps 12), 4 bathrooms, private hot tub, private sauna, fully equipped kitchen, walking distance to slopes. All wood construction, recent build, located in quiet area. Includes mid-week cleaning and all linens/towels.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>How are rooms allocated?</summary>
                    <p>We have 2 double rooms, 1 twin, and 3 others (configuration TBC). Couples get priority for doubles, then first-come-first-served. Everyone gets a proper bed - no sofa beds! Final allocation decided once we know who's coming.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Why La Tania over Courchevel 1850?</summary>
                    <p>La Tania is quieter, better value, and has a proper village feel while still accessing the same ski area. Courchevel 1850 is oligarch territory - a beer costs €12! La Tania gives us the best of both worlds: 3 Valleys access without the silly prices.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What's the ski area like?</summary>
                    <p>The 3 Valleys is the world's largest ski area: 600km of pistes, 328 runs, something for everyone. La Tania sits between Courchevel and Méribel with easy access to both. Beginners can stay local, intermediates can explore different valleys, experts have endless options.</p>
                </details>

            <h2>Food & Drink</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>How does food work?</summary>
                    <p>Flexible approach: some nights we cook together (chalet has full kitchen), some nights we eat out. Mountain lunches are individual choice - meet up or do your own thing. If we book the private chef (£340-420pp), that covers 6 dinners. Budget £50-120 for groceries, £190-280 for meals out.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What about the private chef option?</summary>
                    <p>Professional chef comes to the chalet for 6 nights, prepares 3-course dinners. Costs £340-420pp for the week depending on menu choices. Great option if we want to relax after skiing without worrying about cooking or restaurant bookings.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Any dietary requirements covered?</summary>
                    <p>Most restaurants in the 3 Valleys cater well for dietary requirements. If we book a chef, they'll accommodate specific needs. The chalet kitchen is fully equipped for self-catering if you have strict requirements. Just let us know in advance.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What's this La Folie Douce I keep hearing about?</summary>
                    <p>Legendary mountain party venue in Méribel. Think Ibiza meets the Alps: DJs, dancers, champagne showers, all at 2500m altitude. Shows at 13:30 and 14:40. No cover charge but drinks are pricey (€16 champagne). Absolute must-do but pace yourself!</p>
                </details>

            <h2>Activities & Après-Ski</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What else is there besides skiing?</summary>
                    <p>Loads! Aquamotion spa (free with 6-day pass), tobogganing (€15), snowshoeing, dog sledding, shopping in Courchevel, mountain restaurants, La Folie Douce party, our private hot tub, and plenty of bars for après-ski. Non-skiers won't be bored.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What's the nightlife like?</summary>
                    <p>La Tania: relaxed village vibe with good bars. Courchevel 1850: glitzy and expensive. Méribel: best proper nightlife with clubs. Most nights we'll gather for après-ski drinks then see where the evening takes us. No pressure to party if you want early nights!</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Is it a party trip or skiing trip?</summary>
                    <p>Both! Serious skiing during the day (for those who want it), social evenings, but not a messy 18-30s holiday. Most people are here for good skiing and good company. Some nights are bigger than others - pace yourself for the week.</p>

            <h2>Practical Concerns</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What insurance do I need?</summary>
                    <p>Winter sports insurance is ESSENTIAL. Basic travel insurance won't cover skiing. Ensure it includes: medical expenses, mountain rescue (can cost thousands), equipment cover, and ideally cancellation. Many banks/credit cards include it - check yours. Budget £40-80.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What should I pack?</summary>
                    <p>Essentials: ski jacket/trousers, thermals, ski socks (3+ pairs), gloves, goggles, sun cream (high SPF), lip balm, après-ski clothes, normal clothes, toiletries. The chalet has towels. Don't overpack - you'll be in ski gear most days!</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What about altitude and fitness?</summary>
                    <p>La Tania is at 1400m - most people feel fine. Stay hydrated and take it easy on day one. Skiing is physically demanding so some fitness helps, but technique matters more than strength. The ski lifts do the hard work!</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What if there's no snow?</summary>
                    <p>Extremely unlikely in late December. The 3 Valleys has extensive snowmaking and high altitude runs up to 3200m. Val Thorens glacier skiing is always available. In 10+ years of trips, snow has never been an issue.</p>
                </details>

            <h2>The Group</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>Who usually comes on these trips?</summary>
                    <p>Mostly UK-based professionals aged 25-35, mix of couples and singles, various skiing abilities from complete beginners to off-piste enthusiasts. Everyone's friendly and it's not cliquey. Previous years have been a great mix.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>What if I don't know anyone except Tim?</summary>
                    <p>Perfect! Most people know 1-2 others maximum. The chalet setup means you get to know everyone quickly. Shared transfers, dinners, and après-ski create a good group dynamic. By day 2 it feels like you've known everyone for years.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item" open>
                    <summary>How many people are coming?</summary>
                    <p>Maximum 12 (chalet capacity). Usually we get 10-11 which is a perfect size - big enough for good atmosphere, small enough that everyone gets to know each other. Final numbers confirmed by October/November.</p>
