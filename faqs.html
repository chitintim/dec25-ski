                    <summary>How does this compare to cheaper resorts?</summary>
                    <p>The 3 Valleys is more expensive than Eastern European resorts, but offers reliable snow conditions, modern lift systems, and extensive terrain. The infrastructure is excellent and there's skiing for all abilities. Tim's tried various resorts over the years and keeps coming back here for good reasons.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>I've never skied before - is that OK?</summary>
                    <p>Absolutely! We usually have several beginners each year. La Tania has good beginner slopes and excellent ski schools with English-speaking instructors. Most people are comfortably skiing green runs by day 3. The group is supportive and we often meet for lunch regardless of ability level.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why book as a group rather than individually?</summary>
                    <p>Group booking gets us a whole chalet (better than scattered hotel rooms), coordinated transfers, and often group discounts on equipment and lessons. Tim handles the logistics based on experience from previous trips - knowing which transfers work, where to hire equipment, and how to navigate the resort efficiently.</p>

            <h2>The Practical Stuff</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's included in the accommodation?</summary>
                    <p>The chalet comes with all bedding, towels, bathrobes, mid-week cleaning, end-of-stay cleaning, WiFi, and full use of the hot tub and sauna. The kitchen is fully equipped for self-catering, though most evenings we eat out together.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I join for part of the week?</summary>
                    <p>Unfortunately not - the chalet is booked for the full week and costs are split equally among all participants. It also helps with group dynamics when everyone's there for the full experience.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does room allocation work?</summary>
                    <p>We have 6 bedrooms (2 doubles, 1 twin, 3 TBC). Couples get priority for doubles, then it's first-come-first-served. Everyone gets a proper bed - no sofa beds or floor mattresses.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What about dietary requirements?</summary>
                    <p>La Tania has good restaurants that cater to most dietary needs. When we book group meals, we always check requirements. The chalet has a full kitchen if you need to prepare specific meals.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's the advantage of Tim's local knowledge?</summary>
                    <p>After many visits, Tim knows quieter routes between valleys, which runs hold snow best after fresh falls, good lunch spots off the main circuit, and timing to avoid busy periods. He's also familiar with the best equipment hire shops and has contacts for lessons and guides.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What options are there for advanced skiers?</summary>
                    <p>The 3 Valleys has excellent advanced terrain including the Saulire couloirs, extensive off-piste in the trees around La Tania, and the glacier skiing at Val Thorens. There's always a mix of abilities in the group, and advanced skiers often explore together or with guides.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What are the chalet facilities like?</summary>
                    <p>The hot tub and sauna are private to our group. The hot tub is outside with mountain views - perfect after a day's skiing. There's a good kitchen for group meals, comfortable common areas, and proper bedrooms (no sofa beds). It creates a much better atmosphere than staying in separate hotel rooms.</p>
