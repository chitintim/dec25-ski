# Images Needed for the Site

I can't download images directly, but here are suggestions for what to search for:

## Chalet Photos
- Search: "Chalet La Koala La Tania"
- The Airbnb listing photos
- Interior shots: bedrooms, living area, hot tub
- Exterior views showing proximity to slopes

## Resort Photos
- Search: "La Tania ski resort"
- Village centre
- Ski slopes and lifts
- Mountain views

## 3 Valleys Maps
- Search: "3 Valleys piste map"
- "Les 3 Vall√©es ski map"
- Interactive trail maps

## Generic Alpine Images
- "Courchevel skiing"
- "French Alps winter"
- "Ski chalet hot tub"
- "Alpine sunset"

## Where to Find Free Images
1. **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - Search "skiing", "alps", "chalet"
2. **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Similar searches
3. **Official Resort Sites** - Often have media/press sections
4. **Your Previous Trips** - Best for authenticity!

## Image Tips
- Optimise images before uploading (max 1-2MB)
- Name files descriptively
- Save as .jpg for photos
- Aim for 1920x1080 or similar for hero images
- 800x600 works well for gallery images

## Hero Image Suggestion
For the homepage, a wide shot of the 3 Valleys panorama or a cosy chalet evening shot would work perfectly!
